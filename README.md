### **DISCLAIMER**

This project is a way for me to familiarize myself with Rust, its idioms and its ~~cursed~~ novel module system. There is an astronomically high probability that this will end up in an unmarked grave on my github/codeberg page. By no means should you use it in any serious, dare I say production, capacity as it is 99% likely to fail, crash and burn.

Shoutout to feature creep - I hate you so much.

The idea originated from [Tsoding](https://github.com/rexim), so a big thank you to him for inspiring me to get off my ass and escape tutorial hell.
